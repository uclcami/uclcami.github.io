- title: "Prostate MR image quality of apparent diffusion coefficient maps versus fractional intracellular volume maps from VERDICT MRI using the PI-QUAL score and a dedicated Likert scale for artefacts"
  image: pub1.jpg
  description: This study aimed to assess the image quality of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps derived from conventional diffusion-weighted MRI and fractional intracellular volume maps (FIC) from VERDICT MRI (Vascular, Extracellular, Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours) in patients from the INNOVATE trial. The inter-reader agreement was also assessed.

- title: "Comprehensive Brain Tumour Characterisation with VERDICT-MRI: Evaluation of Cellular and Vascular Measures Validated by Histology"
  image: pub3.png
  description: VERDICT (Vascular, Extracellular, and Restricted DIffusion for Cytometry in Tumours) is a diffusion MRI framework for the characterisation of different components of tumours, which has shown diagnostic utility for body cancer. The aim of this study was to extend the VERDICT framework to comprehensively characterise brain tumours, which is challenging due to the complexity of brain tissues. The resulting biomarkers showed agreement with histology and followed the expected trends when comparing different tumour types and sub-regions. These preliminary results hold promise for the non-invasive characterisation of brain tumours by VERDICT-MRI, which would be an important tool for diagnosis and monitoring of treatment effects.

- title: "Joint estimation of relaxation and diffusion tissue parameters for prostate cancer with relaxation-VERDICT MRI"
  image: pub4.png
  description: This work presents a biophysical model of diffusion and relaxation MRI for prostate called relaxation vascular, extracellular and restricted diffusion for cytometry in tumours (rVERDICT). The rVERDICT model allows for accurate, fast and repeatable estimation of diffusion and relaxation properties of PCa sensitive enough to discriminate Gleason grades 3+3, 3+4 and larger or equal to 4+3.

- title: "Avoiding Unnecessary Biopsy after Multiparametric Prostate MRI with VERDICT Analysis: The INNOVATE Study"
  image: pub5.jpeg
  description: In men suspected of having prostate cancer (PCa), up to 50% of men with positive multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) findings (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System [PI-RADS] or Likert score of 3 or higher) have no clinically significant (Gleason score â‰¤3+3, benign) biopsy findings. Vascular, Extracellular, and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumor (VERDICT) MRI analysis could improve the stratification of positive mpMRI findings. We evaluate VERDICT MRI, mpMRI-derived apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) as determinants of clinically significant PCa (csPCa).

- title: "Differentiating False Positive Lesions from Clinically Significant Cancer and Normal Prostate Tissue Using VERDICT MRI and Other Diffusion Models"
  image: pub6.png
  description: False positives on multiparametric MRIs (mp-MRIs) result in many unnecessary invasive biopsies in men with clinically insignificant diseases. This study investigated whether quantitative diffusion MRI could differentiate between false positives, true positives and normal tissue non-invasively.
